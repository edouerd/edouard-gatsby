title: IBM Community Radio
subtitle: Co-founded and branded IBM Community Radio, a side–project–turned–platform for critical thought, culture renewal, and good music. Prototyped the initial front–end player/schedule interfaces, co-ordinated formative on-air content, and educated folks on how to get up and running quickly on the network. Guerilla advertised the hell out of the first live broadcasts.
