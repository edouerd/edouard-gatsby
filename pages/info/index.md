###### Context —

I was born in Tucson, Arizona.
It is a military town, a university town, an optics town, a hippy town, and a desert town. Each of these respective facets of the city *have* had a huge influence on my design practice, and *will* for the forseeable future.

I spend any extra time I have thinking about art, Mars, and death culture(s).
