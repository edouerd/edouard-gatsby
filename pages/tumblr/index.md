subtitle: At the moment, I'm working on making Tumblr a little bit less introverted. Currently designing how messaging works across all scales, from the one–to–one to the many–to–many. There's also lots of other things happening, but more about that later.

Hi there — At the moment, I'm way too busy to update this 'project(s) page'. There's way too much work to be done! In the meantime, here's a concrete listing of stuff I'm working on these days:

1. Messaging
2. Activity
3. Ads
4. Misc.
