###### tl;dr —

If you're not keen to hear me wax on about New York's siren call and my introductory experiences to Real Design Work, here's a brief listing of products and experiences I've built/contributed to while working at Smart Design:

1. OXO — Angled Baster
2. OXO — Delicate Duster
3. OXO — 2-in-1 Salad Servers
4. Shift — A zine, event, blog, and website collaboration between friends.

###### Introduction —

If you inspect the image above very carefully, you might recognize a piece of New York City that I had grown very close with in the summer of 2012.

What you see above is my after-the-fact rendition of Ludlow and Delancy streets, in the Lower East Side.
